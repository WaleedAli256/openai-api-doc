Below is a detailed description of each data point utilized in this request:\n\n#### Request Details\n\n- **Authentication**: \n  - **Type**: Bearer\n    - This endpoint requires bearer token authentication. You must provide a token in the request header to be authorized.\n\n- **Method**: POST\n  - The request method used for this API call is POST, which means you are sending data to the server to create a new resource.\n\n- **URL**: \n  - `http://localhost:3000/api/action/close/create`\n    - This is the endpoint where the request is sent. It is hosted on the local server.\n\n#### Request Body\n\nThis API expects a JSON body that contains several key-value pairs:\n\n- **sessionId**: \n  - A unique identifier for the session. This helps in tracking the session related to the close action.\n  \n- **accountId**: \n  - The identifier for the user's account that is associated with this request. It specifies which user's data is being manipulated.\n\n- **path**: \n  - A string that signifies the location of the resource involved in the action. In this case, it is a path to a channel/video on the platform (e.g., `/live/channel/video123`).\n\n- **targetType**: \n  - This denotes the type of target for the close action. It can specify categories like 'streamer', which identifies the target as a streamer in this context.\n\n- **targetId**: \n  - The unique identifier for the target resource, such as the specific video that is involved in this request (e.g., `videoId`).\n\n- **sourceType**: \n  - This field indicates the type of source that is generating this request; in this case, it is tied to the `accountId`.\n\n- **sourceId**: \n  - Similar to `accountId`, this serves as the unique identifier for the source related to the close action, which in this case is also the `accountId`.\n\n- **tokenAmount**: \n  - An integer representing the amount of tokens involved in this action. It could refer to a currency or point system where the value is set to 20.\n\n- **name**: \n  - A string that provides a name for the close action. It is useful for identification purposes (e.g., `close1`).\n\n- **description**: \n  - A string for adding a description of the close action. This field can be left empty if there is no additional information to provide.\n\n- **tags**: \n  - A string for any tags that may be relevant to the close action. This can help in categorizing or filtering actions but can also be left empty.\n\n### Summary\nThis endpoint is designed for creating a close action with specific parameters related to users, sessions, and resources. Proper authentication and correctly structured JSON data are required to successfully make a request."
