It is designed to execute a GET request to a specified URL to retrieve a specific search query. \n\nHere’s a closer look at the different components of this endpoint:\n\n1. `name`: This field refers to the name of the endpoint, which is \"Search - Query - Get\" in this case. This name is typically used to identify the endpoint in Postman or similar API testing platforms.\n\n2. `request`: This is the primary part of the endpoint where request details are described.\n\n3. `auth`: The authentication method used by this endpoint. This endpoint uses \"bearer\" authentication type, which sends a token in the 'Authorization' header field to authenticate the client.\n\n    - `bearer`: This is an array whose object(s) describe the key, value, and type of bearer token. For this endpoint, the key is \"token\", the value is \"BearerToken\", and the type is \"string\".\n\n4. `method`: This field defines the HTTP method to be used when the request is sent. For this endpoint, the GET method is used, which primarily retrieves data from a specific resource.\n\n5. `url`: This is the URL where the request is sent. In this endpoint, the request is sent to \"http://localhost:3000/api/search/query/get/?queryId=queryId\". The queryId in the URL is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual queryId to fetch the required data.\n\n6. `headers`: This is an array of headers included in the request. This endpoint has a single empty header, which is disabled by default.\n\n7. `body`: The body of the request, which contains the payload sent to the server. In this case, there's no payload to send with the GET request, so the mode of the body is set to \"raw\" and the actual raw body content is left empty. \n\nRemember that, in the context of HTTP, bearer tokens are sent to user agents by servers in response to a successful authentication. The tokens can then be used to authenticate future requests. Also, GET requests should generally not include a payload as they're meant to be idempotent and safe."

        "description": "1. \"name\": This data field signifies the name of the endpoint. It is called \"Search - Query - Get All By User\". This is essentially an identifier that tells you the purpose of the endpoint. \n\n2. \"request\": Contains all the information required to make an HTTP request. This includes authentication, method, URL, headers, and body.\n\n3. \"auth\": Represents the authentication method to access the endpoint. This is of type \"bearer\", which means that the authorization requires a bearer token to be sent in the request.\n\n4. \"bearer\": This is an array containing the bearer token that will be used for authentication in the request. The \"key\" field is named \"token\", indicating the kind of token used for authentication. The \"value\" field is the token itself, usually generated from the server. The \"type\" field indicates the data type of the \"value\", which is \"string\".\n\n5. \"method\": Represents the HTTP method used for the request. In this case, it is a \"GET\" request, which is used to retrieve information from the server.\n\n6. \"url\": This is the URL or the path of the server where the request is being made. In this case, it's a local server http://localhost:3000/api/search/query/all?. Followed by the URL, there are two query parameters \"accountId\" and \"sessionId\" which are used to filter the results.\n\n7. \"headers\": This is an array that contains the information that the client (or your browser) sends in an HTTP request to the server. It may include any extra information you want to send to the server. In this case, no key-value pairs are provided and it is disabled.\n\n8. \"body\": Contains the body of the request. For a GET method, this will typically be empty as shown here. The \"mode\" indicates how the body data will be sent to the server. In this case, \"raw\" means the data is sent as it is without any encoding or extra processing. There is no raw data provided in this case."
