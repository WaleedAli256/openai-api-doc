It's used for tracking and maintaining state about the user session across multiple requests.\n\n-  `recurringId`: This is the unique identifier for the recurring transaction that needs to be cancelled. It's how the system differentiates one recurring payment from another.\n\n-  `provider`: This is a string that indicates the provider for the transaction system. In this case, it always uses the value `paypal` as it deals specifically with PayPal transactions.\n\nThe `options` section contains a `language` parameter set to `json`. This parameter informs the system that the content of the \"raw' body of the request should be interpreted as a JSON object. \n\nPlease note that values and keys in `raw` body should be quoted to follow JSON syntax properly. \n\nThis endpoint should be used when a recurring PayPal payment needs to be deleted from the system.

Otherwise, it will not.\n\n6. `isPrimary` is also boolean data which signifies whether this recurring payment is the primary method of payment. When set to `true`, this recurring payment will be treated as the primary payment method.\n\n7. `provider` refers to the payment gateway provider. In this case, the provider is 'bitpay', which is an online payment service that allows users to accept cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe headers array is currently empty, meaning there are no additional HTTP headers to send with the request. \n\nThe `body` section of the request is sent in 'raw' mode with the 'json' language option. This means the body contents are presented in a stringified JSON format, allowing structured data to be sent within the request body. \n\nOverall, this endpoint should be used when you want to make changes to an existing recurring payment set up with the 'bitpay' provider."

It represents the unique session during which the operation to create a recurring payment is performed.\n\n- \"source\": It will hold the source of the payment. Currently, this is set as null.\n\n- \"isSaveRecurring\": A boolean flag indicating if the recurring payment needs to be saved. If this is set to true, the recurring payment will be saved for future use.\n\n- \"isPrimary\": This is another boolean field determining whether this particular payment method is primary or not. If set as false, this means the payment method is not a primary one.\n\n- \"provider\": This field specifies the payment provider. In this case, it is \"Venmo\".\n\nThe \"options\" field contains an object with \"raw\", which specifies the language format of the body request, here it is JSON."

This is where the details about the recurring payment that should be deleted are defined:\n\n- 'Mode' indicates the data formatted expected by the endpoint. For this endpoint, the data should come in 'raw', unprocessed form.\n\n- 'Raw' holds the payload data being sent to the API. In this case, it has four fields in JSON format:\n\n  - 'accountId': This is assumed to be the unique identifier of the account from which the recurring payment is set up.\n  \n  - 'sessionId': This is likely a unique identifier for the session in which the delete request is made. It could be used for maintaining session state and tracking.\n\n  - 'recurringId': This is most likely the unique identifier for the recurring payment that is to be deleted.\n\n  - 'provider': As the name suggests, this field specifies who is the service provider of the payment system. It is set to 'Zelle' for this request.\n  \n- 'Options: Raw:Language' indicates the language used to display the raw payload data mentioned above, which is JSON in this case.\n\nPlease ensure to replace the 'accountId', 'sessionId', and 'recurringId' with actual values while making a request to the API.\n\nThis endpoint needs adequate permissions for handling delete operations for recurring payments."
