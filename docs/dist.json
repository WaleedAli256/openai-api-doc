From this URL, we can observe that the request is being sent to an API related to account locations, on a locally hosted server (localhost) running on port 3000. \n\nTwo parameters are required in the root URL - 'sessionId' and 'accountId'. The 'sessionId' parameter is likely tied to the active session of the requester, presumably for security and tracking purposes. The 'accountId' parameter is probably related to the specific account from which all location data are required. Both of these parameters should be populated with appropriate values for this request to function correctly. \n\nBearer token authentication is utilized for this request as specified under the 'auth' section. This indicates that a token, identified by \"BearerToken\" under the bearer section would need to be provided for successful validation and subsequent execution of this request. \n\nNo specific headers are required for this request as the key-value pair under the 'headers' section is left empty and is marked as \"disabled\". \n\nThe 'body' mode for this request is set to 'raw', but since no raw input is mentioned, it is concluded that this endpoint does not need an HTTP body payload. \n\nIn Summary, to use this endpoint, one would need the two parameters 'sessionId' and 'accountId' to be correctly filled in the URL, as well as a valid bearer token to be supplied under the 'auth' section.",

This endpoint lies within your local server running on port 3000. Its path is `/api/account/verify/email`, whereby it's within the 'api', 'account', 'verify', then finally, 'email' subdirectory.\n\nCurrently, it does not contain any custom `headers`. Headers are often used to provide information about the request body and the response, such as its MIME type, or to provide authentication information. If necessary, headers could be added accordingly.\n\nThe `body` of the request is being sent in `raw` mode. Raw mode is used when you want to send information without any encoding. This is useful when you want to send JSON or XML data to the server.\n\nThe raw data being sent consists of two key-value pairs:\n\n- `verificationToken`: The token used to verify the email. This would typically be a unique string that the server generates and sends to the email address for verification.\n- `email`: The email address to be verified. This must match the email address that the server has on record for the associated verification token.\n\nIn normal usage, both `verificationToken` and `email` would need to be replaced with actual data.",

The path of the API is `/api/account/verify/phone`, which is used to verify an account's phone number.\n\n**Headers**: []\nThis field is empty, meaning we're not sending any additional metadata in the header of this HTTP request. Headers often include items like authorization tokens, content type etc. However, none of that is required by this endpoint.\n\n**Body**:\nThe body of the HTTP request is sent in a `raw` format. This is the data that the API takes as input in order to verify a phone number.\n\n- `verificationCode`: This is the code that is used to verify a phone number. Typically, it's sent by an SMS to the phone number that needs to be verified. \n\n- `phone`: This is the phone number that needs to be verified. It needs to be provided so the API knows which phone number it's supposed to verify.\n\nThis endpoint requires both `verificationCode` and `phone` to be present in the raw JSON body of the HTTP request in order to work correctly.\n\nExample of the request body would be:\n```\n{\n  \"verificationCode\": \"123456\",\n  \"phone\": \"+1234567890\"\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the values with the actual verification code received and the phone number to be verified.",

Typically, here you would add any additional headers required by the API, like custom content types or security headers.\n\n- **Body**:\n  - The body of the request is set to \"raw\" mode but is left empty. Since this is a GET request, a body is generally not included. Thus, no data needs to be sent in the body.\n\nThis endpoint, with the correct parameters and a valid bearer token, will return details about the dismissal action specified by the `dismissId`.",

It is required by the server to identify the client making the request.\n   - **Header Value**: `ClientUUID`\n     - You will need to replace this with your actual client UUID.\n\n5. **Request Body**\n   - **Mode**: Raw\n     - The body is sent as a raw JSON string.\n   - **Content**: \n     ```json\n     {\n       \"sessionId\": \"sessionId\",\n       \"accountId\": \"accountId\",\n       \"path\": \"/live/channel/video123\",\n       \"targetType\": \"videoId\",\n       \"targetId\": \"videoId\",\n       \"sourceType\": \"accountId\",\n       \"sourceId\": \"accountId\",\n       \"didReject\": false,\n       \"reason\": \"none\",\n       \"name\": \"\",\n       \"description\": \"\",\n       \"tag\": \"\",\n       \"rejectId\": \"rejectId\"\n     }\n     ```\n     \n   - **Field Descriptions**:\n     - **sessionId**: \n       - Unique identifier for the session in which the action is being performed. It is necessary for tracking the context of the action.\n     - **accountId**: \n       - Unique identifier for the account associated with the action. It represents the user or entity executing the request.\n     - **path**: \n       - The specific path where the action is tied, indicating the resource's location (e.g., a video).\n     - **targetType**: \n       - This specifies the type of the target being acted upon. In this case, it indicates that the target is identified by a video ID.\n     - **targetId**: \n       - The unique identifier for the target resource (e.g., a video ID) that may be rejected.\n     - **sourceType**: \n       - This indicates the type of source the action is originating from, typically an account ID.\n     - **sourceId**: \n       - The unique identifier for the source account that is related to the action.\n     - **didReject**: \n       - A boolean flag that indicates whether the action was rejected (true) or not (false). Defaulting to false means it was not rejected.\n     - **reason**: \n       - A textual explanation for the rejection, if applicable. If not rejected, it may be set to \"none\" or left blank.\n     - **name**: \n       - An optional name associated with the rejection record. This can be left blank if not needed.\n     - **description**: \n       - Optional field to add more details regarding the rejection. It can also be left blank.\n     - **tag**: \n       - Optional labeling for the rejection record that can help with categorization.\n     - **rejectId**: \n       - Unique identifier for this rejection action.

It serves as a unique identifier for the review.\n  - **sessionId**: This parameter represents the session context under which the review was created or accessed. It helps in tracking user sessions.\n  - **accountId**: This parameter indicates the account associated with the review, allowing for filtering based on user accounts.\n\n- **Authentication**: The request requires bearer token authentication. This means that access to this endpoint is secured and needs a valid token to be provided in the request header.\n  - **Bearer Token**: \n    - **Key**: `token`\n    - **Value**: `BearerToken` - This is a placeholder for the actual token that will authorize the request.\n    - **Type**: This is marked as a string, indicating the format of the token.\n\n- **Headers**: The current state of headers shows one placeholder with no key or value and is disabled. This means no additional headers are currently required or sent with this request aside from the authorization token.\n\n- **Body**: The request body is set to raw mode but contains no data. For a GET request, it is typical to not include a body, so this configuration is appropriate.\n\nOverall, this endpoint allows users to retrieve specific review details by providing necessary identifiers in the URL, ensuring that access is controlled through bearer token authentication.",

This is used to authorize the request and ensure that the caller has the necessary permissions to access the endpoint.\n\n- **HTTP Method**: \n  - **Method**: GET\n  - This specifies that the request is intended to retrieve information from the server rather than modifying it.\n\n- **URL**: \n  - **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3000/api/action/revoke/all/`\n  - **Query Parameters**: \n    - **sessionId**: Represents the unique identifier for the user session. This is required to identify the session for which revocation actions are being requested.\n    - **accountId**: Represents the unique identifier for the user's account. This is required to specify which account's revocation actions are being queried.\n\n- **Headers**: \n  - A placeholder for any additional headers required by the request. In this case, the header is currently disabled and does not carry any value or key.\n\n- **Body**: \n  - **Mode**: Raw\n  - **Content**: The body of the request is empty since GET requests generally do not require a body. The raw mode indicates that no formatting is needed.\n\n### Summary\nThis endpoint allows users to fetch all revocation actions by providing a session ID and account ID. It uses a Bearer Token for authentication and follows a standard GET request structure.",

                "description": "The endpoint `Article - General - Create Bulk Auto` is a HTTP `POST` request used to create multiple (\"bulk\") articles in the system.\n\nThe `auth` object is how the API handles authentication. It uses a `type` of \"bearer\", which means it's expecting a bearer token in the request header. The `bearer` array holds key-value pair objects, where the `key` is the \"token\" and its corresponding `value` is the \"BearerToken\" we provide.\n\nThe `url` is the path where the request is sent. In this case, it's a local development server (`localhost`) on port `3000`.\n\nThe `headers` object in the request is currently empty and has `disabled` set to `true`, which means no specific HTTP headers are set for this request.\n\nThe `body` encompasses the actual content of the request. It is sent as `raw` JSON. \n\nThe data in the `body` includes:\n\n- `sessionId`: The unique identifier for the ongoing session.\n- `accountId`: The unique identifier for the user's account.\n- `articles`: An array of objects, with each object representing an individual article and containing:\n  - `title`: The article's title.\n  - `category`: The category the article belongs to.\n  - `subCategory`: Subcategory of the article.\n  - `topic`: Topic of the article.\n  - `date`: The date of the article.\n  - `author`: Author of the article.\n  - `estimatedTime`: Estimated reading time of the article.\n  - `image`: URL of the image related to the article.\n  - `content`: An array representing sections of the article's content. Each section is an object that includes a `type` (either \"text\" or \"section\"), `title` (for \"section\" type), and `content`.\n  - `tags`: An array of tags associated with the article.\n\nNote: The `title` of each article must be unique in the bulk creation. The `date` needs to be in a recognized format like \"DD MM YYYY\". The `image` URL needs to be a valid, publicly accessible URL.\n\nThe `options` object (inside `body`) defines the language of the `raw` input as `json`.\n\nIn summary, this endpoint allows the bulk creation of articles based on the provided JSON data, including details as article title, category, sub-category, author, estimated reading time, image URL, content, and tags. It requires a bearer token for authentication.\n",

It's typically used to send data to a server to create a new resource. \n\nThe URL for this endpoint is \"http://localhost:3000/api/article/subcategory/delete\". This URL suggests that it will be interacting with the subcategories under articles. Specifically, it appears that it will be used to delete an item based on the route \"/delete\". It's highly likely that it's used to delete an article's subcategory.\n\nThe default header key is not provided in the endpoint, hence the empty strings (\"\"). The \"disabled\" field indicates the headers are disabled for this endpoint, meaning that the headers won't be sent along with the request.\n\nThe request body is in raw json format, which directly embodies all the information needed for the request. Within that message body, there are three fields included: \n\n1. \"sessionId\" which probably is used to keep the current logged-in user's session. \n2. \"accountId\" might be used to represent a specific user account that the session belong to. \n3. \"subCategoryId\" that seemingly represents the identification of the subcategory in an article that you want to delete. \n\nThis endpoint appears to be deleting an article's subcategory of an account with a verified session.",

Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **name**: The name of this endpoint is \"Article - Topic - Get All By SubCategory ID\", which explains the primary function of this endpoint. It's designed to fetch all articles within a specified topic that falls under a certain subcategory.\n\n2. **auth**: This section outlines the expected authentication mechanism. The `type` is \"bearer\", indicating that bearer token authentication is required. The bearer token itself should be supplied as the value of the `token` key. Here, \"BearerToken\" is a placeholder for the actual token you need to provide.\n\n3. **method**: This endpoint uses the \"GET\" HTTP method, which is typically used to retrieve information.\n\n4. **url**: This is the URL where the request should be sent. This example uses a local server running on port 3000. The route is \"/api/article/topic/all\". A query parameter `subCategoryId` is required where you are supposed to provide the subcategory ID (`articleSubCategoryId`) of the articles that you want to retrieve.\n\n5. **headers**: This is usually where you define any necessary HTTP headers for your request. However, in this case, a default header without a key-value pair is defined, but it is disabled.\n\n6. **body**: This outlines the structure and mode of the body of your request. However, since we're using a GET method, the body is not required and thus the `raw` field is empty. The `mode` is set to \"raw\", but it won't be used here.\n\nPlease remember to replace placeholders with real values when using this endpoint. Specifically, you should provide a valid bearer token and a valid subcategory ID.",

It specifically fetches chat threads that are owned by a specific user and considers both active and deleted threads. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the components:\n\n1. **name**: This is the title or name of the endpoint, which describes what the endpoint does. In this case, \"Chat - Thread - Get By Owner With Deleted\" suggests that this endpoint retrieves chat threads (both deleted and active) owned by a user.\n\n2. **request**: This details the actual request that will be made to the endpoint.\n\n3. **auth**: This section contains authentication details required to get access to the endpoint. It's using Bearer authentication, which expects a token to be provided. \n\n   - **type**: It indicates the type of authorization being used which is \"bearer\" in this case.\n   \n   - **bearer**: This is an array containing a single object that describes the token needed for authorization:\n     - **key**: This field indicates that a \"token\" is required.\n     - **value**: It shows the placeholder for the value of the bearer token.\n     - **type**: The data type of the \"token\", which is a \"string\".\n\n4. **method**: The type of HTTP request that is being made. In this case, it's a \"GET\" request, meaning it retrieves data from the server.\n\n5. **url**: This is the actual URL where the request will be sent. It includes three query parameters: threadType, threadTypeId, and deleted, which respectively represent the type of thread, ID related with the thread, and the status of deletion.\n\n6. **headers**: The headers field is currently empty and disabled. When enabled, it can contain additional information which will be sent with the HTTP request. For now, no additional information is being passed.\n\n7. **body**: The body carries essential data needed in processing the request. However, for a GET request, no additional body data is required, hence it remains empty.\n\nRemember to replace the \"BearerToken\" with a valid token while making an actual API call. Also, replace the query parameters in the URL with valid threadType, threadTypeId and deleted status to get the desired result.",

The \"auth\" stands for \"authentication\".\n    \n    - `type`: The type of the token used for the authentication. In this case, it is a \"bearer\" which is a method to send authentication data to the server.\n    \n    - `bearer`: This is an array that holds the authentication token details. The `key` attribute indicates how this token is referred in the headers - as 'token'. While the `value` attribute holds the variable 'BearerToken' which stores the actual token value. The `type` must always be a string.\n\n  - `method`: This refers to the HTTP verb used for this request.

The path `/api/connect/contact/all` indicates that we are accessing the 'all' operation in the 'contact' resource of the 'connect' service. The `accountId` is a query parameter that should hold the actual id of the account for which we want to fetch the contact information. \n\n  - `headers`: The headers that should be included in the HTTP request. In this case, there's a `key` and `value` pair which is set to empty by default and has been `disabled`. It means, we can disregard this from request headers as it has no impact on the current request\n\n  - `body`: This is usually where you specify the content of your request. However, for this GET Request, the body has `mode` set to 'raw' and `raw` set to an empty string, meaning, it doesn't need to send any additional data in the request body.\n  \nThis endpoint will respond with all the contact information related to the provided `accountId`.",

It's a POST method, meaning it is used to send data to the server to create a resource.\n\nThe 'auth' field indicates the type of authentication being used, which is 'bearer' type. The 'bearer' array contains a 'token' key needing a 'sessionId' value. It's of 'string' type, which indicates that the 'sessionId' must be a sequence of characters.\n\nThe 'method' is 'POST', which is typically used to submit data to be processed by the identified resource.\n\nThe 'url' is the web address where the POST request is sent. In this case, it's 'http://localhost:3000/api/connect/post/delete', which is an API related to deleting a post on a server running on your own machine (or localhost) at port 3000.\n\nThe 'headers' field includes a default key-value pair that is currently empty and disabled. Headers are used for additional parameters that need to be sent with the API request. \n\nThe 'body' field contains the Data that will be sent with the POST request, which is in 'raw' mode. 'Raw' mode in Postman allows you to send data as a string in the format that you choose. This requires an object containing sessionId, accountId, and postId as strings in a JSON format. \n\n'sessionId' is an unique identifier for a browser session and can be used to manage a user's interaction with the application. 'accountId' refers to the unique identifier of a user's account while 'postId' is the unique identifier of a specific post on the platform. All of these identifiers are sent in the request body indicating the specific user, session and post involved in the interaction.",

It is utilized to fetch all events belonging to a specific sub-category.\n\nLet's take a deeper look at its elements:\n\n1. `name`- This is the name of endpoint which communicates its purpose, in this case, to retrieve all general events by their sub category ID.\n\n2. `request`- This section describes the details of the HTTP request. Here's what each data means:\n\n    - `auth`: This speaks about the authorization method used for the request. The type is `bearer`. A bearer token named \"BearerToken\" is used for authorization.\n\n    - `method`: The HTTP method used for this request is `GET`, which is usually used for retrieving data.\n\n    - `url`: This is the URL endpoint to which the request is sent. It consists of subCategoryId as a query parameter to filter events by their sub-category. Replace `eventSubCategoryId` with the actual sub-category ID for which you want to fetch the events.\n\n    - `headers`: This is an array of headers required by the request. There are no specific headers required for this request as it's empty and disabled by default.\n\n    - `body`: This is the body of the request. However, for this GET request, the body mode is set to `raw`, which means you can send unstructured data. But in this case, there's no data to send so the raw field is empty.\n\nIn conclusion, this endpoint uses a GET method to fetch all general events under a specific sub-category identified by its sub-category ID from the specified URL. It uses a Bearer Token for authorization. The response will contain all the general events data related to the sub-category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                "description": "This API endpoint is called \"Incentive - Loyalty - Get\". This uses the HTTP 'GET' method to retrieve loyalty incentive information.\n\n#### Authentication\nThe authentication required for this endpoint is of the type 'bearer'. This requires a valid token to authenticate the requests made to the endpoint. This token field key is \"token\" and should hold the bearer token string.\n\n#### Method\nThe HTTP method used for this endpoint is GET. This HTTP method is used to retrieve data from the server.\n\n#### URL\nThe 'url' is where the request is being sent. This is where the server is located to handle this specific endpoint. This URL format is http://localhost:3000/api/incentive/loyalty/get and it's parameterized with loyaltyId, sessionId, accountId. \n\n'loyaltyId' - This parameter is used to specify the loyalty program's ID.\n'sessionId' -This parameter is used to maintain the session information.\n'accountId' - This parameter is used to specify the account ID.\n\n#### Headers\nHeaders can be added to amend the request. In the provided data, a header template is included, but it is disabled by default. Hence, this field can be left empty or can be filled with necessary request header info such as content-type, auth-token etc.\n\n#### Body\nThe 'body' carries the bulk of the request information. This endpoint uses 'raw' mode for the body, but as it is a GET request, it doesn't require a body. Therefore, the 'raw' field is left empty. \n\nSo, primarily you need to authenticate yourself and pass the user 'loyaltyId', 'sessionId' and 'accountId' as parameters in the request URL to get the required information.",

This operation is authenticated using the \"Bearer\" type of token authorization. The place of the token is marked as \"BearerToken\", which is meant to hold the actual API client's bearer token as a string to grant access level.\n\nThe request is delivered to the URL: \"http://localhost:3000/api/incentive/reward/all/\", and requires two query parameters: 'sessionId' and 'accountId'. 'sessionId' refers to the unique ID of the user's current session, and 'accountId' is a unique identifier for the user's account. Both are mandatory and should be passed in the URL to ensure the proper functioning of the endpoint by tailoring the response to the specific user and session.\n\nThe endpoint does not require any specific headers, as indicated by the empty key-value pair, and it is also disabled, meaning it can be disregarded entirely in the request.\n\nIn terms of the request body, since this endpoint is using the GET method, no data needs to be sent through the body. It's set to the 'raw' mode, yet the 'raw' body field is left blank. This is to be expected, as GET methods typically do not have a request body. If there's any change in the type of request made to this endpoint, then the body parameters would need to be added under the 'raw' field.",

This action is performed by sending a request to this URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/manage/admin/delete`.\n\nThe endpoint is secured using Bearer Authentication. This means the client must send a Bearer token, which is typically a cryptic string, associated with the request. The key for this token is \"token\" and the value is \"sessionId\". The value will need to be replaced with an actual sessionId for it to work.\n\nThe headers object has been left empty for now but is there in case you need to include required headers in the future.\n\nThe part of the API that does the heavy lifting is the \"body\". Here, the mode is set to \"raw\", meaning that the JSON payload will be sent as a raw block of data. This block includes three pieces of information:\n- \"sessionId\": a unique identifier for your session\n- \"accountId\": a unique identifier for the account under which the admin resides\n- \"adminId\": a unique identifier for the specific admin you want to delete\n\nEach field takes a string as a value and these strings need to be replaced with actual values in order to send the request properly. Also, during the deletion, the system uses these identifiers to ensure that the correct admin is deleted from the right account and session.\n\nPlease replace `\"sessionId\"`, `\"accountId\"`, and `\"adminId\"` with actual values when using this API endpoint.",

It takes the \"raw\" form and needs to be sent as a JSON string.\n\nThe raw body needs to include three properties: \"sessionId\", \"accountId\", \"audioId\". The \"sessionId\" is a repeat of the session ID that is assigned during logging in. This identifies the client's session.\n\nThe \"accountId\" property is also a string and represents the user's account ID. It is necessary to ensure that the operation is performed for the correct user's account. \n\nLast but not least, the \"audioId\" is another string property in the raw payload. This should correlate to the specific ID of the audio media file that you want to be deleted. The system uses this to know the exact audio file to remove in the database or storage.\n\nRemember to appropriately replace the \"sessionId\", \"accountId\", and \"audioId\" placeholders with actual values when you intend to execute the request.",

The type here is string.\n\n2. Request Method: The HTTP method used for this endpoint is 'GET'. This method is primarily designed to retrieve data from the server.\n\n3. URL: \"http://localhost:3000/api/media/video/get/?videoId=videoId&public=1\". This is the URL that will be hit when sending the endpoint request. It contains two parameters:\n   - videoId: This parameter is to provide the unique identifier of the video you want to retrieve.\n   - public: This parameter determines if the video is meant for public viewing. The value of 1 implies it is for the public.\n\n4. Headers: The header fields are not currently used in this endpoint request. It contains an empty key and value. The 'disabled' attribute set to true indicates that this header field may have future uses but is currently not being used.\n\n5. Body: Here the mode is set as 'raw' which means it can send data without any processing. But currently, no data is to be sent in the body, hence it is empty.",

The key for this token is \"token\" and the value expected is \"sessionId\". The type of the token is specified as a \"string\". You need to provide a valid session ID as your token to access this endpoint.\n\n2. **Method** - The HTTP method used is \"POST\", meaning this endpoint is used to send data to the server to create a new resource.\n\n3. **URL** - The endpoint's URL, where the request is sent, is specified as \"http://localhost:3000/api/notification/invites/delete\". Bear in mind this is a local URL and might be different in production or other environments.\n\n4. **Headers** - Headers can be used to provide additional information about the request. In this case, the key and value are empty, and the type is set as \"default\". Also, this option is currently disabled.\n\n5. **Body** - The request body here is in raw format. This contains the actual information that is to be sent to the server. It's a JSON with the keys \"sessionId\", \"accountId\", and \"invitesId\" which presumably refer to the session, account, and invites identifiers, respectively.\n\nRemember that incorrect auth tokens, URLs or body parameters could lead to unsuccessful requests. Use valid information according to your database to avoid such issues.",

Here, `Bearer` authentication is being used, and the bearer token should be placed in the value of the `token` key. \n\n- `method`: Specifies the HTTP method used, in this case, `GET`, meaning the API call will retrieve data from the server.\n\n- `url`: Specifies the URL the request will be sent to. In this case, it looks like the URL is calling an API locally and is intended to fetch all loyalty notifications. There are two query parameters, `sessionId` and `accountId`, which likely need to be populated with a valid session ID and account ID respectively when calling this API. \n\n- `headers`: Contains information that the client (user's browser, for instance) sends to the server. In this case, it appears that headers are not necessarily required to call the given endpoint as the key and value are empty and the header is disabled.\n\n- `body`: Contains information sent to the server if data needs to be sent along with the `GET` request. For this particular request, no raw data is being sent in the body. The `mode` is set as `raw`, but the `raw` value is an empty string.

This is just an identifier to help you remember what this endpoint does.\n\n2. **Request**: This property holds the information regarding the HTTP request made to the server.\n\n   - **Auth**: The 'auth' attribute suggests that user must have valid authorization to access this endpoint. It requires 'Bearer Token' type authorization. Users should replace string 'BearerToken' with a valid bearer token value to authenticate the request.\n\n   - **Method**: 'GET' is the HTTP request method used. GET is used to request data from a specified resource.\n\n   - **URL**: 'http://localhost:3000/api/notification/streamers/get/?streamersId=streamersId&sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId' is the URL which will be hit by the API call. It includes query parameters that need to be replaced with actual 'streamersId', 'sessionId' and 'accountId' based on the user's requirements.\n\n   - **Headers**: These can be used to provide additional information about the request. In this case, the key and value fields are empty, and the 'disabled' field is set to 'true', which means that this header is not actually sent with the request.\n\n   - **Body**: Defines the body of the HTTP request. In this case, it is set to 'raw' mode with the raw field being empty. As it's a GET request, typically there wouldn't be need for any content in the body.\n\n3. Note: All query parameters ('streamersId', 'sessionId', 'accountId') are required, so please ensure you replace placeholders with valid values before sending the request.",

It does not modify or add to the data on the server, it only requests and receives data.\n\n3. **URL**: This is the unique address where the request will be sent. It's designed for a local server running on port 3000. The full URL structure includes two query string parameters; localhost:3000/api/notification/university/all/?sessionId={sessionId}&accountId={accountId}. \n    - `sessionId` is a parameter which holds the value of the current session. This is mainly used for state management.\n    - `accountId` is the unique identifier for a user account. This could be used to retrieve notifications related only to this specific account.\n\n4. **Headers**: In this case, there are default headers attached to the request that are currently disabled - meaning these headers are not sent along with the request. Since both key and value are not provided, these headers do not carry any additional information for the request.\n\n5. **Body**: As a GET request, this endpoint does not send any data (raw or form data) in the request body.

It is designed to create a payment charge using the Zelle payment method. \n\nThe request uses the \"POST\" method, which means it's used to submit data to be processed to the identified resource. The URL that the request is sent to is 'http://localhost:3000/api/payment/charge/create'. \n\nThe request body is in raw mode, representing an unparsed sequence of characters. The data sent via this method is in JSON format (Javascript Object Notation, a human-readable and easy-to-parse data exchange format).\n\nThe data included in the body are as follows:\n\n- `accountId`: This field is used to specify the unique identifier for the account undertaking the transaction. Replace \"accountId\" with the actual account ID.\n  \n- `sessionId`: This field requires the session ID value. It is the unique identifier for the current transaction session. Replace \"sessionId\" with the active session ID.\n  \n- `source`: This field is for providing the source of the funds for the payment. However, in this given case it's null as Zelle doesn't require any source.\n  \n- `isSaveCharge`: This is a boolean (true or false) field. If set to 'true', it means that the charge information for this transaction should be saved for future reference or use.\n\n- `isPrimary`: This is another boolean field. If set to 'true', it implies that the current payment method (Zelle) is set as the primary method of payment. In this case, it is set to 'false', meaning that Zelle is not the primary method.\n  \n- `provider`: This field represents the payment provider. In this case, it is set to \"zelle\". You may replace this with other providers if needed.\n\nInside the 'options' field, the 'language' is set to 'json'. This indicates that the request body is coded in JSON language.",

It is set up for a `POST` request, which typically implies data submission or an action involving manipulation or deletion of data.\n\nThe URL for this request is `http://localhost:3000/api/payment/product/delete`. It suggests that this endpoint could be used to delete a product from a payment collection stored locally (localhost:3000) via the API route `/api/payment/product/delete`.\n\nThere are no specific headers set for this request, which might suggest there's are no restrictions related to language, origin, authorization etc, unless, they're already handled in some different way.\n\nThe request body is configured in `raw` mode. It consists of a JSON object that is expected to contain four properties:\n\n1. `accountId` : This is likely to be a unique identifier for a user account within your system. You should replace \"accountId\" with the actual ID of the account.\n\n2. `sessionId`: It seems like an identifier for the current session. It could be used for verifying that the user session is valid. Replace \"sessionId\" with the actual session ID.\n\n3. `productId`: This appears to be a unique identifier for the product that is intended to be deleted. Replace \"productId\" with the actual product ID.\n\n4. `provider`: This is set as \"zelle\". It indicates that the payment provider for the product is Zelle.\n\nLastly, under options, you have `raw` which is set to a `language` of `json`. It signifies that the API expects the request payload raw data to be in JSON format. Make sure to send request body content as JSON. \n\nIn summary, this \"Product - Zelle - Delete\" endpoint takes a JSON object with four properties (accountId, sessionId, productId, provider) as a body payload and is likley to delete a specific product under an account.",

For this endpoint, the data should come in 'raw', unprocessed form.\n\n- 'Raw' holds the payload data being sent to the API. In this case, it has four fields in JSON format:\n\n  - 'accountId': This is assumed to be the unique identifier of the account from which the recurring payment is set up.\n  \n  - 'sessionId': This is likely a unique identifier for the session in which the delete request is made. It could be used for maintaining session state and tracking.\n\n  - 'recurringId': This is most likely the unique identifier for the recurring payment that is to be deleted.\n\n  - 'provider': As the name suggests, this field specifies who is the service provider of the payment system. It is set to 'Zelle' for this request.\n  \n- 'Options: Raw:Language' indicates the language used to display the raw payload data mentioned above, which is JSON in this case.\n\nPlease ensure to replace the 'accountId', 'sessionId', and 'recurringId' with actual values while making a request to the API.\n\nThis endpoint needs adequate permissions for handling delete operations for recurring payments.",

If necessary, it could include more information about the transaction or user.\n\n4. `isSaveRecurring`: This field should be a boolean. If set to true, it indicates that the transaction is a recurring one and should be saved for potential future recurring transactions.\n\n5. `isPrimary`: This field should be a boolean. If set to true, it will set the transaction as a primary transaction for the user's account.\n\n6. `provider`: This field should be a string indicating the payment provider.

Ensure that the bearer token you provide here is a valid session identifier. In the input data, you'll find a `key` titled `token` with a `value` identifier named `sessionId`. The `type` of these data fields is a string.\n\n- Method: The HTTP request method for this endpoint is POST, used primarily to send data to the server to create/update a resource.\n\n- URL: The URL to communicate with the API is `http://localhost:3000/api/reports/earning/delete`. This endpoint specifically deals with deleting earning reports.\n\n- Headers: The headers here include a default `key` and `value` pair which are both empty and disabled, implying that no additional headers are required for this particular API call.\n\n**Body:**\n\nThis refers to the actual content or data you're sending to the server through your HTTP request, containing the following information:\n\n- Mode: The mode of the data encapsulated in the body of this request is identified as `raw`. In simple terms, this implies that the data is sent in an unprocessed manner, as a string of text.\n\n- Raw: The `Raw` field is where the actual data to be sent to the server is embedded. In this case, the raw data is in JSON format and it contains three strings: `sessionId`, `accountId`, and `earningId`. These are all identifiers; `sessionId` pertains to the session in context, `accountId` relates to the user account and `earningId` is the unique identifier for the specific earning report you wish to delete.",

As the name suggests, it is used to delete reports associated with a particular team. \n\nThe authentication type for this endpoint requires a \"Bearer Token\".  It uses the bearer authentication scheme whereby the bearer of the token sends it in the Authorization header.\n\nAn example of the token usage:\n\"type\": \"Bearer token sessionid\"\nHere, \"sessionid\" is representing the value that needs to be provided for the \"Bearer Token\".\n\nThe HTTP method for this endpoint is \"POST\", meaning it's designed to send data to the server for a specific resource.\n\nThe URL indicates the location where this request is sent. In this case, we are performing an action on \"http://localhost:3000/api/reports/team/delete\". This is the address to which the 'POST' request is made.\n\nThe headers field is empty in this example and has been disabled as well. Headers hold additional information (key-value pairs) to be sent with the request, but it's not being used in this case.\n\nThe request body is sent in 'raw' format and contains the data to be sent to the server. This raw information is a JSON object containing three parameters:\n\n1. \"sessionId\": This is likely an identifier used by the server to validate your session. In a fully-fledged application, this would be dynamically replaced with an active session ID.\n2. \"accountId\": This is likely the identifier for your account, used to determine which account to perform the action on.\n3. \"teamId\": This is probably the identifier for a specific team. It's what helps the server know which team's reports you're intending to delete.\n\nTo successfully make a request to this endpoint, these input parameters must be replaced with real values according to your system's specifications.",

This name suggests that the endpoint is responsible for retrieving all filter items related to a specific user based on a search operation. Here's a detailed breakdown of each data component:\n\n1. \"request\": This is the main body of the request for this endpoint.\n\n2. \"auth\": This refers to the authentication method used for this request. In this instance, a \"bearer\" type authentication is utilized.\n\n   - \"bearer\": This is an authentication method that involves sending a bearer token. In this case, the token's key is simply \"token\", and the value is \"BearerToken\". The token type is a string.\n\n3. \"method\": This is the HTTP method used for the API call. For this endpoint, a \"GET\" method is used, indicating that it retrieves particular resources.\n\n4. \"url\": This is the URL of the API that the call is sent to. The endpoint can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/api/search/filter/all/` with two query parameters, `accountId` and `sessionId`.\n\n5. \"headers\": This section is used to send additional information about the API request. In this case, the key and value fields are empty and disabled, meaning no additional header details are required for the API call.\n\n6. \"body\": This section represents the data that is sent with the API request. The mode is set to \"raw\" but no data is meant to be sent with this request hence the \"raw\" field is empty. This suggests that this API endpoint only needs the information available in the URL to complete its operation.",
