In this case, it is a \"bearer\" token which is commonly used for accessing secured endpoints.\n\n    - **bearer**: This is an array that contains details about the bearer token.\n      \n      - **key**: This denotes the identifier for the token, set as \"token\".\n      \n      - **value**: The actual token value that should be used for the authentication. It is represented as \"BearerToken\", which should be replaced with a valid token when making requests.\n      \n      - **type**: Specifies the data type of the token, which is a string.\n\n  - **method**: This indicates the type of HTTP request method being used. In this case, it is a \"GET\" method, meaning the request is intended to retrieve data from the server.\n\n  - **url**: The endpoint URL for making the API request. It contains query parameters that specify what data to retrieve.\n    \n    - `http://localhost:3000/api/utility/coin/get/`: The base URL pointing to the API service running on the local server.\n    \n    - `?log=deduction`: A query parameter that specifies the type of log to retrieve, indicating that only deduction logs are needed.\n    \n    - `&sessionId=sessionId`: A placeholder for a session identifier. This should be replaced with an actual session ID to filter logs related to a specific session.\n    \n    - `&accountId=accountId`: A placeholder for the account identifier. This should be replaced with an actual account ID to retrieve logs associated with that account.\n  \n  - **headers**: This section is meant for any additional HTTP headers that may need to be sent with the request.\n    \n    - **key**: Usually defines the name of the header.\n    \n    - **value**: Specifies the value for that header.\n    \n    - **type**: Indicates the type of header, which is set to \"default\" in this case.\n    \n    - **disabled**: A boolean that indicates whether the header is currently disabled (set to true here, meaning this header is not included in the request).\n\n  - **body**: This part represents the payload sent with the request. Since this is a \"GET\" request, the body is usually empty.\n    \n    - **mode**: Indicates the mode of the body. Set to \"raw\", meaning the body can be sent in a raw format, although no content is supplied here.\n    \n    - **raw**: This field contains the actual body data. In this case, it is empty, as GET requests typically do not contain a body.\n\nThis detailed breakdown provides clarity on each component used for the API request, facilitating better understanding and usage for users of the Postman collection."
