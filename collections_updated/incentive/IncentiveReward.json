Here are the main components:\n\nAuthentication (\"auth\"): This endpoint uses bearer token authentication. You need to provide a token in the 'BearerToken' field to authenticate your request.\n\nRequest Type (\"method\"): The type of the request is PUT which means it is used to update or replace an existing resource.\n\nURL (\"url\"): The URL to send the request to is \"http://localhost:3000/api/incentive/reward/update\".\n\nHeaders: This request contains one header, \"Client-UUID\". This is presumably uniquely identifying your client to the server.\n\nRequest Body (\"body\"): This contains all the information needed to update a reward. It is in raw JSON format. The fields are:\n\n- \"sessionId\": The unique identifier of the current session.\n- \"accountId\": The unique identifier of the account.\n- \"rewardId\": The unique identifier of the reward.\n- \"name\": The name of the reward.\n- \"description\": A short explanation about the reward.\n- \"tags\": A list of tags describing the reward, which can be used for search or categorisation.\n- \"rewardType\": The type of reward (in this case, \"token\").\n- \"rewardTypeId\": A unique identifier for the reward type.\n- \"tokenAmount\": The amount of tokens provided by the reward.\n- \"profilePhotoUrl\": A URL referencing an image which represents the reward.\n- \"coverPhotoUrl\": A URL pointing to the reward's cover photo.\n- \"videoPlaybackUrl\": If there is any video associated with the reward, its URL will be placed here.\n- \"audioPlaybackUrl\": URL for any audio file related to the reward.\n\nOptions (\"options\"): These specify that the body is to be interpreted as raw JSON input.\n\nRemember, the values provided here - such as \"BearerToken\", \"ClientUUID\", and the placeholder values in the body - are just placeholders. You need to replace them with your actual data before making a request."

Use it to conveniently identify this request among others in your collection.\n\n2. **request.auth.type**: \"bearer\". This denotes the type of authorization used for this request which is 'bearer' token in this case. Bearer token authorization leverages a security token for authorization management.\n\n3. **request.auth.bearer**: It is an array of object. The object contains three properties:\n    - **key**: \"token\". It is the type of authorization value you are going to use.\n    - **value**: \"BearerToken\". This would be the actual token value. Replace 'BearerToken' with the actual token when making a real API call.\n    - **type**: \"string\". It represents the data type of token and it is a string.\n\n4. **request.method**: \"GET\". This is the HTTP method used for this request. 'GET' method is used to retrieve information from the server.\n\n5. **request.url**: \"http://localhost:3000/api/incentive/reward/get/?rewardId=rewardId&sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId\". This is the URL where the request will be sent. The URL contains three query parameters - rewardId, sessionId and accountId. Replace these parameters with actual values when making a real API call.\n\n6. **request.headers**: An array used to define any headers to be sent along with the request. In this case, no headers are required as the object inside the array is empty and disabled.\n\n7. **request.body.mode**: \"raw\". Indicates that the request body will be sent as a raw string. However, in this GET request, there is no need to send a body, hence the raw value is an empty string.\n\n8. **request.body.raw**: \"\"(empty string). As it's a GET request, it does not contain a body. It means no additional data is sent to the server."

This operation is authenticated using the \"Bearer\" type of token authorization. The place of the token is marked as \"BearerToken\", which is meant to hold the actual API client's bearer token as a string to grant access level.\n\nThe request is delivered to the URL: \"http://localhost:3000/api/incentive/reward/all/\", and requires two query parameters: 'sessionId' and 'accountId'. 'sessionId' refers to the unique ID of the user's current session, and 'accountId' is a unique identifier for the user's account. Both are mandatory and should be passed in the URL to ensure the proper functioning of the endpoint by tailoring the response to the specific user and session.\n\nThe endpoint does not require any specific headers, as indicated by the empty key-value pair, and it is also disabled, meaning it can be disregarded entirely in the request.\n\nIn terms of the request body, since this endpoint is using the GET method, no data needs to be sent through the body. It's set to the 'raw' mode, yet the 'raw' body field is left blank. This is to be expected, as GET methods typically do not have a request body. If there's any change in the type of request made to this endpoint, then the body parameters would need to be added under the 'raw' field."
