The following details outline the structure and expected input for the request:\n\n#### Request Authentication\n- **Auth Type:** Bearer\n  - This indicates that the request requires a bearer token for authentication. \n  - **Bearer Token:**\n    - *Key*: `token` \n    - *Value*: The value should be prefixed with \"Bearer\" followed by a space and then the actual token (e.g., \"Bearer {YourActualToken}\").\n    - *Type*: String\n\n#### Request Method\n- **Method:** POST\n  - This specifies that the request type is a POST method, typically used for creating new resources.\n\n#### Request URL\n- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/action/read/create`\n  - This is the endpoint on the server where the request will be sent. The `/create` part indicates that it is for creating a new read action.\n\n#### Request Headers\n- **Headers:**\n  - Currently, no specific headers are defined as the key and value fields are empty. However, headers can typically be used for content type or other authentication details if needed.\n\n#### Request Body\n- **Body Mode:** Raw\n  - The body of the request is provided in raw format as a JSON string.\n\n- **Raw JSON Structure:**\n  ```json\n  {\n      \"sessionId\": \"sessionId\",\n      \"accountId\": \"accountId\",\n      \"path\": \"/live/channel/video123\",\n      \"targetType\": \"streamer\",\n      \"targetId\": \"videoId\",\n      \"sourceType\": \"accountId\",\n      \"sourceId\": \"accountId\",\n      \"tokenAmount\": 20,\n      \"name\": \"read1\",\n      \"description\": \"\",\n      \"tags\": \"\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### JSON Field Descriptions\n- **sessionId:** \n  - This is a string that represents a unique identifier for the session in which the read action is taking place. \n\n- **accountId:** \n  - A string that identifies the account associated with the read action.\n\n- **path:** \n  - The path is a string that specifies the location of the resource being read. In this case, it shows a live channel path.\n\n- **targetType:** \n  - A string that specifies the type of target being accessed. In this context, \"streamer\" indicates that the target is a streaming service or channel.\n\n- **targetId:** \n  - This string represents the unique identifier of the target resource. It should be the ID of the video or stream being accessed.\n\n- **sourceType:** \n  - This indicates the type of source from which the action is being initiated. Here, it is identified by \"accountId.\"\n\n- **sourceId:** \n  - A string that denotes the unique identifier of the source from which the read action originates.\n\n- **tokenAmount:** \n  - A numeric value indicating the amount of tokens or credits used in this read action. In this case, it is set to 20.\n\n- **name:** \n  - A string that provides a name for the read action, allowing for easier identification.\n\n- **description:** \n  - A string meant for additional information about the read action. It is currently empty but can be populated with relevant details.\n\n- **tags:** \n  - A string intended for categorizing or tagging the action for easier searching or filtering. It is also currently empty.\n\nThis detailed breakdown of each field should help users understand the required structure and purpose of the data being sent with this API request."
