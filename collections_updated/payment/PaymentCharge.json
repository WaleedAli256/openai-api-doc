In this case, it is set to 'false', meaning that Zelle is not the primary method.\n  \n- `provider`: This field represents the payment provider. In this case, it is set to \"zelle\". You may replace this with other providers if needed.\n\nInside the 'options' field, the 'language' is set to 'json'. This indicates that the request body is coded in JSON language."
