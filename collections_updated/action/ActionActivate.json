It must be replaced with a valid token before making the request.\n    - **Type**: `string`  \n      The data type of the token is a string.\n\n- **Method**: `POST`  \n  This indicates that the request method to interact with the endpoint is POST, which is typically used to create new resources.\n\n- **URL**:  \n  `http://localhost:3000/api/action/activate/create`  \n  This is the endpoint URL where the request is sent. It indicates that the action will be activated by creating a new resource.\n\n- **Headers**:  \n  - **Key**: (empty string)  \n    No specific headers are needed for this request, as the header entry is disabled.\n  - **Value**: (empty string)  \n    Since the key is disabled, there is no associated value.\n\n#### Body:\n\n- **Mode**: `raw`  \n  Indicates that the format of the body content being sent is raw data, specifically in JSON format.\n\n- **Raw**:  \n```json\n{\n    \"sessionId\": \"sessionId\",\n    \"accountId\": \"accountId\",\n    \"path\": \"/live/channel/video123\",\n    \"targetType\": \"streamer\",\n    \"targetId\": \"videoId\",\n    \"sourceType\": \"accountId\",\n    \"sourceId\": \"accountId\",\n    \"tokenAmount\": 20,\n    \"name\": \"activate1\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"tags\": \"\"\n}\n```\n  This JSON object contains the necessary data for creating and activating an action. \n\n  - **sessionId**: `sessionId`  \n    Identifier for the current session. This is required to link the action to a specific session.\n\n  - **accountId**: `accountId`  \n    Represents the ID of the account associated with this action. This will associate the activated action with the user’s account.\n\n  - **path**: `\"/live/channel/video123\"`  \n    Specifies the path to the resource that is being activated. This typically points to a live channel or media stream.\n\n  - **targetType**: `\"streamer\"`  \n    Indicates the type of target for the action. In this case, it specifies that the target is a streamer.\n\n  - **targetId**: `\"videoId\"`  \n    This represents the identifier of the target, which could be a video ID related to the activation.\n\n  - **sourceType**: `\"accountId\"`  \n    This indicates the type of source from which the action originates. Here, it’s linked to the account.\n\n  - **sourceId**: `\"accountId\"`  \n    This corresponds to the source ID, which in this case is the same as the account ID.\n\n  - **tokenAmount**: `20`  \n    Represents the quantity of tokens involved in this action. This could be a currency or a unit of measure related to the activation.\n\n  - **name**: `\"activate1\"`  \n    A user-defined name for this activation action, useful for identification purposes.\n\n  - **description**: `\"\"`  \n    An optional field for a description of the activation. Currently left empty.\n\n  - **tags**: `\"\"`  \n    This is also an optional field for adding tags to the action, currently left empty.\n\n#### Options:\n- **Raw**:  \n  - **Language**: `json`  \n    This indicates that the raw body content is formatted in JSON."

It should be replaced with the actual session identifier.\n  - **accountId**: This parameter is required to specify the account associated with the session. It should be replaced with the actual account identifier.\n  \n  Example of the full URL incorporating the parameters could look like:\n  ```\n  http://localhost:3000/api/action/activate/all/?sessionId=12345&accountId=67890\n  ```\n\n#### Headers\n- **Headers**: \n  - Currently, there are no additional headers needed for the request, as the headers section is left empty and disabled. In future implementations, if any custom headers are required, they can be added in this section.\n\n#### Body\n- **Body**:\n  - The body of the request is not used in this GET request method, meaning no data is sent in the request body. It is indicated as empty, which is standard for GET requests.\n\nThis description serves as a reference for users to understand how to utilize the \"Action - Activate - Get All\" endpoint effectively."
