In this case, it is a 'bearer' token.\n      \n    - **bearer**: \n      - An array which holds the authorization token needed to authenticate the request.\n      \n      - **key**: \n        - This is a placeholder for the token key. It is labeled 'token' which indicates that this is where your access token will be placed.\n        \n      - **value**: \n        - This is the actual token value, prefixed with 'Bearer'. Replace 'BearerToken' with the actual bearer token for successful authentication.\n        \n      - **type**: \n        - This specifies the data type of the token, which is 'string'.\n\n  - **method**: \n    - This indicates the HTTP method used for the API request. The method here is 'GET', which is intended to retrieve data.\n\n  - **url**: \n    - This is the endpoint URL that should be called.

Currently, it is empty and disabled, which means no additional headers are being sent.\n      \n    - **value**: \n      - Represents the value of the header. Since the key is empty, this is also not set.\n      \n    - **type**: \n      - Denotes the type of the header. It is set to 'default'.\n\n    - **disabled**: \n      - This boolean flag indicates whether the header is active.

It is set to 'raw', suggesting that the body content will be sent as a raw string.\n    \n    - **raw**: \n      - This is where the actual body content would go if required. Currently, it is empty, meaning no data will be sent in the request body since this is a GET request.\n\n#### Usage\nTo use this endpoint, ensure that you replace the `accountId` in the URL with the actual account ID you wish to query, and enter a valid bearer token in place of `BearerToken` in the authorization section."
