The token should be provided in the header of the request as follows:\n  - **Key:** token\n  - **Value:** BearerToken (replace this placeholder with your actual bearer token)\n\n---\n\n#### Request Body\n\nThe request body should be sent in JSON format with the following fields:\n\n1. **sessionId** (String)  \n   Unique identifier for the session. This helps in tracking user activities within the current session.\n\n2. **accountId** (String)  \n   Unique identifier for the user account. This specifies which user's points are being created or modified.\n\n3. **targetType** (String)  \n   The type of target entity associated with the action. For example, it could refer to a user's account ID or another identified entity. In this case, the value is set to \"accountId\".\n\n4. **name** (String)  \n   A name assigned to the point creation event. This serves as an identifier or label for the operation, such as \"TTP.\"\n\n5. **description** (String)  \n   A brief explanation of the point event. This provides additional context. In this example, it is \"Team Tournament Point.\"\n\n6. **type** (String)  \n   This field indicates the category of the point creation. The value \"platform\" might suggest that points are allocated based on platform-specific actions.\n\n7. **action** (String)  \n   The action type to be associated with the point creation. In this instance, it is set to \"award,\" indicating that points are being awarded to a user.\n\n8. **rate** (Integer)  \n   The rate at which points are granted. Here, it is set to 1, potentially indicating that one point is awarded per qualifying action.\n\n9. **amount** (Integer)  \n   The total amount of points to be awarded during this operation. In this case, it is set to 5, meaning five points will be credited to the user's account.\n\n---\n\n#### Headers\n- There are no additional headers defined in this request, and the provided header entry is disabled.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Ensure to replace placeholder values (like `sessionId`, `accountId`, and `BearerToken`) with actual data for making valid API requests."

Ensure to replace placeholder values such as `sessionId`, `accountId`, `teamId`, etc., with appropriate identifiers before making the request. Each point entry includes details like the target type, action, rate, and amount, indicating how and for what reason points are being created or allocated."

In this case, it is \"bearer\", meaning that a token will be used for authorization.\n    \n    - **Bearer**: This is the array containing the bearer token information.\n      \n      - **Key**: The key name for the bearer token, labeled \"token\".\n      \n      - **Value**: The actual bearer token that will be sent with the request. It is represented as \"BearerToken\", which needs to be replaced with a valid token.\n      \n      - **Type**: Indicates the data type, which is \"string\" in this context.\n\n  - **Method**: This specifies the HTTP method used for the request. Here, it is a \"GET\" request, which is typically used to retrieve data from the server.\n\n  - **URL**: This is the endpoint URL to which the request will be sent. The URL is structured as follows:\n    \n    - Base URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/utility/point/get/`\n    - Query Parameters:\n      - `balance=1`: This query parameter is used to indicate that the balance information is being requested.\n      - `sessionId=sessionId`: This query parameter is for passing a session identifier, which may be used to maintain state or track user sessions.\n      - `accountId=accountId`: This parameter is used to specify the account for which the balance is being requested.\n\n  - **Headers**: This section is for any additional headers that might be required for the API request.\n    \n    - The example shows an empty header, with both \"key\" and \"value\" set to empty strings. It is also marked as \"disabled\", indicating that this header will not be sent. If needed, valid headers can be added here.\n\n  - **Body**: This element contains the body of the request.\n\n    - **Mode**: Specifies the mode for sending the body, which is set to \"raw\" indicating the body content will be plain text or raw data.\n    \n    - **Raw**: This field is empty, meaning no body content is sent with the GET request. Typically, GET requests do not send a body, so this is appropriate.\n\nThis structured information facilitates understanding how to interact with the API for retrieving the utility point balance effectively."
