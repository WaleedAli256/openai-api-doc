  description: >-
    This endpoint, "Events - Category - Get All", is a GET request used to
    retrieve all categories of events. This is how each component is used:


    1. `name`: This is the title or alias of the endpoint. "Events - Category -
    Get All" is a human-friendly name referring to the operation serving to
    fetch all event categories.


    2. `auth`: It refers to the method by which the service authenticates the
    user. This endpoint uses bearer token authentication (`type: "bearer"`). A
    bearer token is a type of access token that allows the holder of the token
    to access the API. It is supplied under the `value` key as a string datatype
    in the `bearer` array. Replace `"BearerToken"` with your actual bearer token
    when making the request.


    3. `method`: Refers to HTTP methods. In this case, "GET" is the HTTP method
    used. It is used to request data from a specified resource.


    4. `url`: This is the Server URL or API's endpoint.
    "http://localhost:3000/api/events/category/all" is the address we are making
    the request to. It should be replaced with the actual server's URL when
    deployed.


    5. `headers`: In this collection, the headers field has no key-value pair;
    therefore, it's disabled and does not have any effect on the request.


    6. `body`: Here, the body mode is set to "raw" which means that the HTTP
    request body contains data as a raw string. However, there is no raw data
    being sent in this request.
