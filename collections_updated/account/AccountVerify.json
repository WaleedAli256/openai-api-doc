It is designed to verify an email address linked to an account. \n\nIt uses the `POST` method, which allows it to send data to the server to create a new entry in the database. The `POST` method is often used when submitting filled forms.\n\nThe URL for this endpoint is `\"http://localhost:3000/api/account/verify/email\"`. This endpoint lies within your local server running on port 3000. Its path is `/api/account/verify/email`, whereby it's within the 'api', 'account', 'verify', then finally, 'email' subdirectory.\n\nCurrently, it does not contain any custom `headers`. Headers are often used to provide information about the request body and the response, such as its MIME type, or to provide authentication information. If necessary, headers could be added accordingly.\n\nThe `body` of the request is being sent in `raw` mode. Raw mode is used when you want to send information without any encoding. This is useful when you want to send JSON or XML data to the server.\n\nThe raw data being sent consists of two key-value pairs:\n\n- `verificationToken`: The token used to verify the email. This would typically be a unique string that the server generates and sends to the email address for verification.\n- `email`: The email address to be verified. This must match the email address that the server has on record for the associated verification token.\n\nIn normal usage, both `verificationToken` and `email` would need to be replaced with actual data."

It's typically used to send data to a server to create a new resource.\n\n**URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/account/verify/phone`\nThis is the URL at which the API needs to be hit. Since we're in a local development environment, we're using `localhost`. The port we're using to access the local server is `3000`. The path of the API is `/api/account/verify/phone`, which is used to verify an account's phone number.\n\n**Headers**: []\nThis field is empty, meaning we're not sending any additional metadata in the header of this HTTP request. Headers often include items like authorization tokens, content type etc. However, none of that is required by this endpoint.\n\n**Body**:\nThe body of the HTTP request is sent in a `raw` format. This is the data that the API takes as input in order to verify a phone number.\n\n- `verificationCode`: This is the code that is used to verify a phone number. Typically, it's sent by an SMS to the phone number that needs to be verified. \n\n- `phone`: This is the phone number that needs to be verified. It needs to be provided so the API knows which phone number it's supposed to verify.\n\nThis endpoint requires both `verificationCode` and `phone` to be present in the raw JSON body of the HTTP request in order to work correctly.\n\nExample of the request body would be:\n```\n{\n  \"verificationCode\": \"123456\",\n  \"phone\": \"+1234567890\"\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the values with the actual verification code received and the phone number to be verified."
