Now let's dive into each aspect of this endpoint:\n\n1. \"name\": This property indicates the name of the endpoint, which is \"Article - Category - Get By Short ID\".\n\n2. \"request\": This property contains the majority of the data for running this API call. \n\n3. \"auth\": This property describes the authentication method used for this API request. This endpoint uses the 'bearer' token type. The \"bearer\" array includes:\n    - \"key\": This signifies the type of data being sent in the bearer token. In this case, it is \"token\".\n    - \"value\": The \"BearerToken\" specifies the expected value. It should be replaced with a valid token string while using this endpoint.\n    - \"type\": This characterizes the data type of the token. As mentioned here, it's a string.\n\n4. \"method\": This property mentions the HTTP method to be used, which in this case is \"GET\".\n\n5. \"url\": This is the API's endpoint URL where the Get request is being sent. \"http://localhost:3000/api/article/category/get/?shortId=articleCategoryShortId\" is the URL, and 'articleCategoryShortId' at the end is a placeholder for the short identifier that should be used to fetch the specific article category.\n\n6. \"headers\": This array usually contains any additional HTTP headers to be sent with the API request. However, in this case, the \"key\" and \"value\" fields are empty, and the header is set to disabled. It would appear that there are no additional headers required for this endpoint.\n\n7. \"body\": This part of the request contains the data that is going out with the request. In this case, the mode is set to 'raw', and the 'raw' field is empty since there's no data to be sent with the GET request. \n\nIn summary, this endpoint is intended to fetch a specific article category by its 'shortId' using a GET request. It requires a bearer token for authentication."

It's probably for deleting a specific category associated with an article in your application/system.\n\n2. **Request**: This is the main part of the endpoint that carries the necessary information for processing the request on the server.\n\n   - **Auth**: Refers to the authentication type used. Here \"bearer\" token type is used. It contains a key named \"token\", which should hold a string type value which here is termed as \"sessionId\". This is likely for authenticating the request.\n\n   - **Method**: This is the HTTP method used, which is \"POST\". It's generally used to send data to a server to create a new resource.\n\n   - **URL**: This is the address to which this request is going to be sent.

Here the mode used is \"raw\", meaning you are sending the data as directly inputted without any alterations.\n   \n       - The raw data contains three properties: \"sessionId\", \"accountId\", and \"categoryId\". These are likely to be identifiers for the session, the account, and the category of the article that is being deleted.\n        \nThis endpoint sends a POST request to delete a specific article's category from your application. It uses a bearer token authentication and requires the session ID, account ID, and category ID to be included in the body of the request."
