It indicates that the request is to retrieve all videos in the education category.\n\n**Request:**\n- This section describes the details needed to make the API request.\n\n  **Auth:**  \n  - **Type:** Specifies that the authentication method used is a bearer token. Bearer tokens are commonly used for authenticating API requests, ensuring that the user has the right to access the requested resources.\n  - **Bearer:** This includes an array with the bearer token details.\n    - **Key:** The name of the token parameter, which is \"token\".\n    - **Value:** The actual token used for authorization, which in this case is represented as \"BearerToken\". Users need to replace this placeholder with their actual bearer token.\n    - **Type:** Indicates the type of the token, which is a string.\n\n  **Method:**  \n  - This specifies the HTTP method used for the request. In this case, it is a \"GET\" method, which is typically used to retrieve data from the server.\n\n  **URL:**  \n  - This is the endpoint to which the request will be sent. The URL provided is:\n    ```\n    http://localhost:3000/api/video/category/all/?sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId&searchType=Education&category=Classroom\n    ```\n    - It includes several query parameters:\n      - `sessionId`: A placeholder for the user's session ID, which is required for the request.\n      - `accountId`: A placeholder for the user's account ID, needed to identify the user's account.\n      - `searchType`: Set to \"Education\" to filter the videos based on the education category.\n      - `category`: Set to \"Classroom\" to specify a subset of the education category.\n\n  **Headers:**  \n  - This is an array that includes HTTP headers for the request. In this case, the array is present but contains a single header with no key or value and is marked as disabled. This suggests that no additional headers are needed beyond what is provided in the authorization section.\n\n  **Body:**  \n  - This section is where data can be sent in a request body. It specifies:\n    - **Mode:** The mode of the body, which is set to \"raw\". This means that the body will contain raw data instead of form or JSON data.\n    - **Raw:** This is where the actual data would go when the body is sent, but it is currently empty in this instance. Since this is a GET request, typically no body is needed.\n\nThis detailed description should help users understand the purpose and structure of the API endpoint when using your Postman collection."
