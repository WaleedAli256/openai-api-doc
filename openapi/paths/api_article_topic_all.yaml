  description: >-
    - "name": This is the name of the endpoint. In this case, the name given is
    "Article - Topic - Get All", which implies that this endpoint probably
    fetches all topic-related articles.


    - "request": A descriptor for the type of HTTP request being made. The
    properties that follow within this hierarchy present more specific details
    about the request.


    - "auth": This is an authorization object. In this case, it's of type
    'bearer', which is a method of authentication that involves sending a bearer
    token.

        - "type": Specifies the authentication method used. Here, the "Bearer" HTTP authentication scheme is being used.
      
        - "bearer": This array contains the information for bearer authentication which includes:
          - "key": This is the header field name used to pass the bearer token, in this instance it's 'token' 
          - "value": This is where the actual bearer token is placed. In this instance, the placeholder is 'BearerToken'.
          - "type": The data type of the 'value'. In this case, it's a string.

    - "method": The type of HTTP method used for the request. Here, it's a "GET"
    method, used to retrieve data from a server.


    - "url": The URL to where the request is being sent. Here, the request is
    being sent to "http://localhost:3000/api/article/topic/all", which is likely
    to be an API endpoint for getting all topics of articles.


    - "headers": HTTP headers that will be included in the request. In this
    example, no specific headers are included as the key-value field is kept
    empty and it is disabled. If it was enabled, the listed key-value pair would
    have been sent as an HTTP header.


    - "body": Defines the body of the request. In this case, the "mode" is set
    to "raw", meaning the HTTP request body will contain raw (unprocessed) data.
    However, no raw content has been provided in this endpoint, so it's left as
    an empty string. This makes sense since, for a "GET" request, you usually do
    not need a request body.
