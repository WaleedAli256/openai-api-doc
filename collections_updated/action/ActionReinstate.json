Below is a detailed description of each data point in the request body:\n\n- **sessionId**: This is a unique identifier for the session associated with the reinstatement action. It is required to link the reinstatement to the specific session context.\n\n- **accountId**: This represents the identifier for the account performing the action. It is crucial for authorizing the request and ensuring that the action is being carried out by the correct user.\n\n- **path**: This is the specific path of the resource that is being reinstated. In this example, it points to a live channel video, which indicates that the action is related to streaming content.\n\n- **targetType**: Indicates the type of target being reinstated. In this case, it is specified as \"streamer\", meaning that the action is aimed at a streamer account.\n\n- **targetId**: This is the unique identifier for the specific target resource (e.g., the video or streamer) being reinstated. It connects the action to the individual entity.\n\n- **sourceType**: This field specifies the type of source from which the reinstatement is being initiated. It is set to \"accountId\", indicating that the source is an account identifier.\n\n- **sourceId**: This is the identifier for the source account associated with the reinstatement. It should match the account that is initiating the reinstatement process.\n\n- **tokenAmount**: This number indicates the amount of tokens being used or affected by the reinstatement. In this example, the value is set to 20.\n\n- **name**: This field provides a name for the reinstatement action. It can be used to identify or label the action for future reference, with \"reinstate1\" as a sample name.\n\n- **description**: This is an optional field for providing additional information about the reinstatement action. In this instance, it is left empty, but users can include any relevant details if necessary.\n\n- **tags**: This optional field allows users to categorize the reinstatement action using tags. It is useful for organization and searching purposes but is left empty in this example.\n\n### Request Configuration\n- **Auth**: The endpoint requires bearer token authentication for authorization. The token must be sent with the request to validate the user's identity and permissions.\n\n- **Method**: The HTTP method for this request is POST, which is used to submit data to the server to create a new resource.\n\n- **URL**: The endpoint URL is `http://localhost:3000/api/action/reinstate/create`, where the request should be sent.\n\n- **Headers**: Currently, there is a placeholder for headers that is disabled. Users can customize or add headers as needed for the request.\n\n- **Body**: The request body is sent in raw JSON format and contains all the parameters necessary for creating a reinstatement action as described above."
