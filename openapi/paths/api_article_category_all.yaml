  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Article - Category - Get All". It is intended to
    retrieve all categories associated with articles.


    The "request" object holds all necessary information to make the HTTP
    request itself.


    "auth" is an object containing the authentication details. It is of type
    "Bearer". The "bearer" array consists of an object with three properties -
    "key", "value", and "type".


    - "key" is the constant string "token"

    - "value" will be your Bearer token. This is typically a long series of
    alphanumeric characters generated by the server for authenticating requests.

    - "type" indicates that the value should be a string, so ensure that the
    token is a string in your routine.


    The "method" is "GET". This HTTP method is used to retrieve data from the
    server.


    "url": This is the URL endpoint that you will use in order to carry out the
    aforementioned "GET" request. The specified URL is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/article/category/all".


    "headers": An array of header objects that can be sent along with the
    request. Currently, this includes a default empty header object that is
    disabled.


    The "body" object holds the details of the body of the request. In this
    case, the "mode" is set to "raw", which means you can insert raw data into
    the body. However, as this is a "GET" request, the "raw" field is empty as
    "GET" requests generally do not include a body.
