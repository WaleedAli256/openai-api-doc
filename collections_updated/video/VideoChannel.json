        "description": "### Endpoint: Video - Channel - Create\n\nThis endpoint allows users to create a new video channel with various customizable settings. Below is a detailed description of each data field in the request body.\n\n#### Request Body Fields:\n\n- **sessionId**: Represents the unique identifier for the current user session. This is used to track the user's activity and ensure that actions are associated with the correct session.\n\n- **accountId**: This is the unique identifier for the user's account. It links the channel to the specific account of the user creating it.\n\n- **name**: The name of the channel. It is how the channel will be identified and searched. For example, \"Fortune\".\n\n- **description**: A brief description of the channel, providing insights into the content or the purpose of the channel. For example, \"This channel is by Fortune Vieyra\".\n\n- **tags**: A comma-separated list of keywords associated with the channel. Tags help categorize the channel and make it easier for users to find content, such as \"second,channel\".\n\n- **profilePhotoUrl**: The URL link to the profile photo of the channel. This image represents the channel visually across the platform. For example, \"https://example.com/profile.jpg\".\n\n- **coverPhotoUrl**: The URL link to the cover photo of the channel. This is the larger image that appears at the top of the channel page, providing a visual identity. For example, \"https://example.com/cover.jpg\".\n\n- **minimumTipAmount**: The minimum amount that a viewer can tip the channel creator. This is defined in the currency set by the platform. For example, the minimum tip could be 10 units.\n\n- **unlockAmount**: The amount required to unlock specific content or features in the channel. For example, an unlock amount of 1 unit might be charged to access exclusive videos.\n\n- **category**: The main category that the channel falls under. This helps users navigate channels by content type. An example would be \"General\".\n\n- **subCategory**: A more specific classification within the main category. This helps further refine the channelâ€™s classification, such as \"Specific\".\n\n- **searchType**: Specifies the type of content that can be searched within the channel. For example, \"Game\" indicates that the channel may focus on gaming-related content.\n\n- **isEnabled**: A boolean value indicating whether the channel is currently active and visible to users. If set to true, the channel is enabled.\n\n- **isChannelPrivate**: A boolean value that specifies whether the channel is private and only accessible to selected viewers. If true, only invited users can view the channel.\n\n- **isTournamentOnly**: A boolean that indicates if the channel is exclusively for tournaments. If set to true, only tournament-related content will be available.\n\n- **isChannelDefault**: A boolean value indicating whether this channel should be set as the default channel. If true, it may be the first option users see when accessing video channels.\n\n- **isPreLiveVideoAds**: A boolean indicating whether ads are shown before the live video starts. If true, viewers will see ads prior to the content.\n\n- **isPostLiveVideoAds**: A boolean indicating whether ads are shown after the live video ends. If true, viewers will see ads after the content concludes.\n\n- **breakPreLiveVideoUrl**: URL to a video that will be played during breaks before the live video starts. This content can keep viewers engaged until the live stream begins.\n\n- **breakLivePauseVideoUrl**: URL to a video that will play if the live stream is paused. This ensures viewers have something to watch rather than a blank screen.\n\n- **breakPostLiveVideoUrl**: URL to a video that will play after the live stream ends. This could contain highlights or additional content related to the channel.\n\nThis collection allows for detailed channel creation, catering to various aspects of user engagement and content management."
