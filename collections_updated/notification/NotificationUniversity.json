This is mainly used for state management.\n    - `accountId` is the unique identifier for a user account. This could be used to retrieve notifications related only to this specific account.\n\n4. **Headers**: In this case, there are default headers attached to the request that are currently disabled - meaning these headers are not sent along with the request.
