This token is used to authenticate the request to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to perform the action.\n\n- **Method**: \n  - **POST**: This HTTP method is used to send data to the server for creating a new resource.\n\n- **URL**: \n  - `http://localhost:3000/api/action/block/create`: This is the endpoint where the request is sent. It is the local server address which handles the blocking action creation.\n\n- **Headers**: \n  - Currently, there are no specific headers being set since the provided key-value pair is disabled. Typically, headers can be used to provide additional context to the request, such as content-type or any necessary custom headers.\n\n#### Body\n- **Mode**: \n  - **Raw**: The body of the request is formatted as raw JSON.\n\n- **Raw Content**: \n```json\n{\n    \"sessionId\": \"sessionId\",\n    \"accountId\": \"accountId\",\n    \"path\": \"/live/channel/video123\",\n    \"targetType\": \"videoId\",\n    \"targetId\": \"videoId\",\n    \"sourceType\": \"accountId\",\n    \"sourceId\": \"accountId\",\n    \"name\": \"\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"tags\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n- **JSON Fields**:\n  - **sessionId**: A unique identifier for the session during which the block action is being created. This helps in associating the action with a particular user session.\n  \n  - **accountId**: The ID of the account requesting to block content. This connects the block action to a specific user.\n\n  - **path**: A string that specifies the route of the content that is being blocked. In this example, it refers to a live channel and includes the identifier for the video.\n\n  - **targetType**: Indicates the type of the target being blocked, in this instance, it is specified as a `videoId`.\n\n  - **targetId**: The unique identifier for the content (such as a video) that is being targeted for blocking.\n\n  - **sourceType**: Defines the type of account that is initiating the block action. It is represented here as `accountId`.\n\n  - **sourceId**: Refers to the ID of the account from which the block action is initiated. It should correspond to the `accountId`.\n\n  - **name**: An optional field where the user can provide a name for the block action. This could be used to label the action for easier identification.\n\n  - **description**: An optional field for a brief explanation or notes about the block action being created.\n\n  - **tags**: This field can be used to include keywords or tags associated with the block action, assisting in categorization or retrieval of information later.\n\nThese details should help users understand the requirements and structure of the request when creating a block action through the specified API endpoint."
