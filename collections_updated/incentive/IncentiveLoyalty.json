        "description": "This API endpoint is called \"Incentive - Loyalty - Get\". This uses the HTTP 'GET' method to retrieve loyalty incentive information.\n\n#### Authentication\nThe authentication required for this endpoint is of the type 'bearer'. This requires a valid token to authenticate the requests made to the endpoint. This token field key is \"token\" and should hold the bearer token string.\n\n#### Method\nThe HTTP method used for this endpoint is GET. This HTTP method is used to retrieve data from the server.\n\n#### URL\nThe 'url' is where the request is being sent. This is where the server is located to handle this specific endpoint. This URL format is http://localhost:3000/api/incentive/loyalty/get and it's parameterized with loyaltyId, sessionId, accountId. \n\n'loyaltyId' - This parameter is used to specify the loyalty program's ID.\n'sessionId' -This parameter is used to maintain the session information.\n'accountId' - This parameter is used to specify the account ID.\n\n#### Headers\nHeaders can be added to amend the request. In the provided data, a header template is included, but it is disabled by default. Hence, this field can be left empty or can be filled with necessary request header info such as content-type, auth-token etc.\n\n#### Body\nThe 'body' carries the bulk of the request information. This endpoint uses 'raw' mode for the body, but as it is a GET request, it doesn't require a body. Therefore, the 'raw' field is left empty. \n\nSo, primarily you need to authenticate yourself and pass the user 'loyaltyId', 'sessionId' and 'accountId' as parameters in the request URL to get the required information."
