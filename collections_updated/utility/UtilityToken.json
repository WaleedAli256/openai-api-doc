Below is a detailed description of each component of the request.\n\n#### Request\n\n- **Method**: `PUT`\n  - This indicates that the request is intended to update an existing resource.\n\n- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/utility/token/update`\n  - This is the endpoint where the request is sent. It assumes the service is running locally on port 3000.\n\n#### Authentication\n\n- **Auth Type**: `Bearer`\n  - The request uses bearer token authentication, which means the user must provide a token that grants access to the API.\n  \n- **Bearer Token**:\n  - **Key**: `token`\n  - **Value**: `BearerToken`\n    - This field should contain the actual bearer token for authentication. Replace `BearerToken` with the valid token that has been issued to the user.\n\n#### Headers\n\n- **Key**: `Client-UUID`\n  - **Value**: `ClientUUID`\n    - This header should contain a unique identifier for the client making the request. Replace `ClientUUID` with the actual UUID that identifies the client application.\n\n#### Body\n\n- **Mode**: `raw`\n  - The body of the request is sent in raw format.\n\n- **Raw Content**:\n  - The body contains a JSON object with the following fields:\n  \n  - **sessionId**: `\"sessionId\"`\n    - This is the unique identifier for the user session that needs to be updated. Replace it with the actual session ID.\n  \n  - **accountId**: `\"accountId\"`\n    - This is the unique identifier for the account associated with the token. Replace it with the actual account ID.\n  \n  - **tokenId**: `\"e87e4e08-1669-4f59-a5e7-3ec9101812fe\"`\n    - This is a unique identifier for the token that needs to be updated. Ensure it is the correct token ID that corresponds to the account.\n  \n  - **targetType**: `\"accountId\"`\n    - Specifies the type of target for the update. In this case, it indicates that the target is an account, as specified by `accountId`.\n  \n  - **name**: `\"BPT\"`\n    - This is the name associated with the token. Replace with the relevant name as needed.\n  \n  - **type**: `\"platform\"`\n    - Indicates which platform the token is related to. Typically, this could refer to different services or platforms against which the token is used.\n\n  - **action**: `\"sell\"`\n    - This defines the action to be taken. In this example, it suggests that the user is selling something related to the token.\n  \n  - **amount**: `1000`\n    - This specifies the amount relevant to the action being performed (e.g., the amount of currency or tokens to sell). Adjust this to reflect the correct amount for the intended operation.\n\n#### Summary\n\nThis PUT request is designed to update a user's token settings in the system. Be sure to replace placeholder values with actual identifiers and values to ensure the request is processed correctly."
