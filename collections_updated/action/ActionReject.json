It requires a PUT request and is authenticated via a bearer token.\n\n#### Request Structure\n\n1. **Authentication**\n   - **Type**: Bearer\n     - This specifies that the request uses bearer token authentication.\n   - **Token**: \n     - This is where you will input your authentication token. It is essential for gaining access to the API resources.\n\n2. **Method**\n   - **PUT**: \n     - This indicates that the request will update an existing resource or create a new resource if it does not exist.\n\n3. **URL**\n   - **Endpoint URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/action/reject/update`\n     - This is the local server address where the request will be sent to perform the action of updating the rejection status.\n\n4. **Headers**\n   - **Header Key**: `Client-UUID`\n     - This header is used to pass the client's universally unique identifier. It is required by the server to identify the client making the request.\n   - **Header Value**: `ClientUUID`\n     - You will need to replace this with your actual client UUID.\n\n5. **Request Body**\n   - **Mode**: Raw\n     - The body is sent as a raw JSON string.\n   - **Content**: \n     ```json\n     {\n       \"sessionId\": \"sessionId\",\n       \"accountId\": \"accountId\",\n       \"path\": \"/live/channel/video123\",\n       \"targetType\": \"videoId\",\n       \"targetId\": \"videoId\",\n       \"sourceType\": \"accountId\",\n       \"sourceId\": \"accountId\",\n       \"didReject\": false,\n       \"reason\": \"none\",\n       \"name\": \"\",\n       \"description\": \"\",\n       \"tag\": \"\",\n       \"rejectId\": \"rejectId\"\n     }\n     ```\n     \n   - **Field Descriptions**:\n     - **sessionId**: \n       - Unique identifier for the session in which the action is being performed. It is necessary for tracking the context of the action.\n     - **accountId**: \n       - Unique identifier for the account associated with the action. It represents the user or entity executing the request.\n     - **path**: \n       - The specific path where the action is tied, indicating the resource's location (e.g., a video).\n     - **targetType**: \n       - This specifies the type of the target being acted upon. In this case, it indicates that the target is identified by a video ID.\n     - **targetId**: \n       - The unique identifier for the target resource (e.g., a video ID) that may be rejected.\n     - **sourceType**: \n       - This indicates the type of source the action is originating from, typically an account ID.\n     - **sourceId**: \n       - The unique identifier for the source account that is related to the action.\n     - **didReject**: \n       - A boolean flag that indicates whether the action was rejected (true) or not (false). Defaulting to false means it was not rejected.\n     - **reason**: \n       - A textual explanation for the rejection, if applicable. If not rejected, it may be set to \"none\" or left blank.\n     - **name**: \n       - An optional name associated with the rejection record. This can be left blank if not needed.\n     - **description**: \n       - Optional field to add more details regarding the rejection. It can also be left blank.\n     - **tag**: \n       - Optional labeling for the rejection record that can help with categorization.\n     - **rejectId**: \n       - Unique identifier for this rejection action. This helps track individual rejection actions and may be required for further processes."
