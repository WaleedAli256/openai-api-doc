This requires the user to provide a valid token in the request header for authorization to access the resource.\n\n#### URL:\n- **Endpoint**: The endpoint to access this action is `http://localhost:3000/api/action/dislike/create`. This should be changed to the appropriate server URL in production.\n\n#### Headers:\n- **Headers**: There are no specific headers set in the request at this time. The default headers are disabled and not in use.\n\n#### Body:\nThe body of the request is sent in raw JSON format and contains the following key-value pairs:\n\n1. **sessionId**: This is a string that identifies the session in which the dislike action is being recorded. It helps in tracking the user's current state or interaction session.\n\n2. **accountId**: This represents the unique identifier for the user account making the dislike action. It is essential for associating the dislike with the correct user.\n\n3. **path**: This is a string that indicates the path of the content being disliked. For example, it points to the location of the video, such as `/live/channel/video123`.\n\n4. **targetType**: Specifies the type of target that the dislike is directed toward. In this case, it is set to `videoId`, indicating that the action pertains to a video.\n\n5. **targetId**: This is the unique identifier of the content that is being disliked. In this example, it is labeled `videoId`, representing the specific video the user is interacting with.\n\n6. **sourceType**: Denotes the type of the source from which the dislike action is being made. It is set to `accountId`, indicating that the action originates from a user account.\n\n7. **sourceId**: This is the unique identifier associated with the source. It is also set to `accountId`, signifying the identity of the user making the dislike action.\n\n8. **didDislike**: A boolean value that indicates whether the user disliked the content or not. Here, it is set to `false`, suggesting that the action is intended to indicate a dislike (i.e., changing from a non-dislike state).\n\n9. **isUndo**: This is another boolean value. If it is set to `true`, it means the user is undoing a previous dislike action. It is set to `false`, indicating that this is a fresh dislike action rather than an undoing of a previous one.\n\n10. **name**: This is an optional field that can hold a name or title related to the dislike action. Currently, it is an empty string, awaiting user-defined input if necessary.\n\n11. **description**: Another optional field, intended for additional information or notes regarding the dislike action. It is currently left empty.\n\n12. **tags**: This optional field allows for additional tagging related to the dislike action. It is also an empty string and can be used to categorize or provide more context if needed.\n\nThis endpoint is designed to create a dislike action against a specific piece of content, capturing relevant information about the user and the disliked item."
